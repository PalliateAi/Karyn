                    </div>
                    <p class="mb-30">I was into a showbusiness family - My father owned and operated carnival rides and games and my mother was a soubrette..a singer, dancer in 
                      the touring tent shows that travelled all over Australia. They met when all the showmen went one night to watch one of the tent shows and they fell in love.. the rest is Australian showbusiness histonry.
                      My brothers and I naturally went into the same business. They owning and operating rides and games, the same as our father. I went onto the stage like mum, at a very early age.</p>
                    <p class="mb-30">I was only 4 years old when I first performed a tap dance on stage in Sydney and it went on from there. By the age of 6
                      I was a singer/dancer on the Reg Quartley and Captain Fortune Shows on television and also learnt the solo trapeze.. always good to have a different talent up your sleeve at that age.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-30">I landed my first major stage role at the age of 8 playing the juvenile lead in Robin Hood at the famous Tivoli Theatre in Sydney. I was also lucky enough to be a cast as one of the Freddo Frong Gang and the GI Girl for National Television. I must of kept my mother real busy trasping around Australia while I did all these appearences.</p>
                    <p class="mb-30">By the time I was 12 I was the lead singer in the Junior Australians - a group of kids aged 7 to 16 to toured the country performing on stage and television. Fun times</p>
                    <p class="mb-30">It all happened after that, if that wasn't already enough. I went on to perform at the Roxy Revue Theatre Restaurant. Singin with people such as Sammy Davis Junior, toured with the Glitter Sisters. That is where I got to sing with the late and great Bob Hope and was then cast as the Star to be and a Boylan Sister in the Australian Tour of Annie</p>
                    <p class="mb-30">Many more major stage roles followed including Jesus Christ Superstar, They're Playing Our Song and Candide performed with the ABC Orchestra - Both on stage and on television</p>
                    <p class="mb-30">At the age of 21 I played Maria in West Side Story and not long after, took over the lead role in musical; Evita. How about that? What a role to get. The biggest and best part for a woman in musical theatre and I loved every minute of it. A great, demanding show to do</p>
                    <p class="mb-30">I then came to London and landed the role of Maria in West Side Story in the West End. Another WOW moment of my life. A real honour to be playing a leading role in West End in London - the holy grail of theatre. I then played Janet in The Rocky Horror Show. So different, so much fun and then there were more roles in rep.</p>
                    <p class="mb-30">I returned home to vist my family and wow I was asked to play the role of Alexandra in the brand new musical, Rasputin</p>
                    <p class="mb-30">Back in London I plyed Giulietta is Aspects of Love and performed my own one woman show. Lately I've been singing with a 3-piece Jazz band. "Nice work if you can get it"</p>
